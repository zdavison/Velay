Velay is a visual MIDI delay effect written in Processing.

You can use it with any MIDI hosting application of your choice. Just define an input and an output, and then use it as you want.

Play around with resizing the window, and play some notes. You'll get the hang of it quickly.

----------------------------------

To just download processing, download velay.zip from the bin branch above.

If you want to mess around with the code, you'll want: 

G4P (http://www.lagers.org.uk/g4p/distribution/web/index.html) 
ProMIDI (http://creativecomputing.cc/p5libs/promidi/)

Enjoy.
